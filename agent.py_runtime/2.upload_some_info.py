I told myself I was prepared, that I had always known the truth deep down. That he never saw me the way I saw him. But knowing something and feeling it are two different things. I saw him today—with her. They weren’t even trying to hide it. The way he looked at her, the way she laughed at something he said, the way their hands brushed and neither of them pulled away. It was so natural, so effortless. And I just stood there, watching a dream I never even had the courage to chase slip through my fingers. I wanted to be angry, but there’s no one to blame. He never made promises, never led me on. He was just being himself, while I was the one who built a fantasy out of stolen glances and wishful thinking. Maybe this is for the best. Maybe now I can finally stop hoping, stop waiting for something that was never meant to be.")

Just to see what it feels like, to have the words leave my lips instead of circling endlessly in my mind. But every time I think about it, my throat tightens, and the words disappear before they even reach the surface. I like him. No—I think I might love him. That thought alone terrifies me. I don’t even know when it started. Maybe it was the way he laughs, like he isn’t just amused but truly happy. Or the way he pushes his hair back when he’s thinking, completely unaware of how effortlessly charming he looks. It’s stupid, isn’t it? That something so small, so ordinary, could make my heart race.")
